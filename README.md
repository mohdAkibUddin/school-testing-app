Created an application where we have a teacher who can log in and make an exam and questions to the exam that are python based. Also, a student could take an exam the teacher makes and sees their grade once the teacher makes the exam available to him or her. We also made our own custom backend using data cloud and use that to store and manipulate the data and also grade the python exams.
